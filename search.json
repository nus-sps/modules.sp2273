    "text": "Welcome(Z)\nComputing plays a vital role in how science understands and engages with the world. Often regarded as the third pillar of science, alongside theory and experiment, it enables us to explore complex questions in ways that would otherwise be impossible.\nIn this course, you will discover how computers can be used to solve fun and intriguing problems in interdisciplinary science, including topics such as climate, disease spread, DNA, language, and polling. You will learn to tackle complexity by breaking down problems, identifying patterns, focusing on essential data, and designing step-by-step solutions.\nAlong the way, you will gain hands-on experience with the Python programming language and develop practical skills in computational thinking and problem-solving. These skills will be valuable in both your studies and future career. You will also have the opportunity to build and refine your interpersonal and collaboration skills through a group project.",
